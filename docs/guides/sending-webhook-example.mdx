In this guide, you'll learn how to deploy your first webhook event with Convoy. You'll be making use of your project API key which can be generated by creating a project from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/). You'll also need your project ID which can be retrieved from your **Project Settings** page.

#### Install Client

Install convoy.js with:

```bash terminal
npm install convoy.js
```

#### Configure

```js example
const { Convoy } = require('convoy.js');
const convoy = new Convoy({ 
	api_key: 'your_api_key',
	uri: 'your_uri'
});
```

In the event you're using a self-hosted convoy instance, you can add your instance uri. But if you are using the cloud base service, your `uri` will either be the following base on the region you register as:
- `https://us.getconvoy.cloud/api/v1`
- `https://eu.getconvoy.cloud/api/v1`


Now that your client has been configured, create a convoy application.

#### Create an Endpoint

```js example
try {
	const endpointData = {
		url: 'https://0d87-102-89-2-172.ngrok.io',
		description: 'Default Endpoint',
		secret: 'endpoint-secret',
		events: ['*']
	};

	const response = await convoy.endpoints.create(appId, endpointData);
} catch (error) {
	console.log(error);
}
```

The next step is to create a subscription to the webhook source. Subscriptions are the conduit through which events are routed from a source to a destination on Convoy.

#### Subscribe for Events

```js example
try {
	const subscriptionData = {
		name: 'event-sub',
		endpoint_id: endpoint_id
	};

	const response = await convoy.subscriptions.create(subscriptionData);
} catch (error) {
	console.log(error);
}
```

With the subscription in place, you're set to send an event.

#### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need the uid from the endpoint you created earlier.

```js example
try {
	const eventData = {
		endpoint_id: endpoint_id,
		event_type: 'payment.success',
		data: {
			event: 'payment.success',
			data: {
				status: 'Completed',
				description: 'Transaction Successful',
				userID: 'test_user_id808'
			}
		}
	};

	const response = await convoy.events.create(eventData);
} catch (error) {
	console.log(error);
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Ruby">

#### Install Client

Install convoy.rb with:

```bash terminal
gem install convoy.rb
```

#### Configure

To configure your client, provide your api_key and project_id, see below:

```ruby
require 'convoy'

Convoy.ssl = true
Convoy.api_key = "CO.M0aBe..."
Convoy.project_id = "23b1..."
```

#### Create an Endpoint

An endpoint represents a target URL to receive webhook events. You should create one endpoint per user/business or whatever scope works well for you.

```ruby
endpoint = Convoy::Endpoint.new(
  data: {
    "description": "Endpoint One",
    "http_timeout": "1m",
    "url": "https://webhook.site/73932854-a20e-4d04-a151-d5952e873abd"
  }
)

endpoint_response = endpoint.save
```

#### Subscribe for Events

After creating an endpoint, we need to subscribe the endpoint to events.

```ruby
subscription = Convoy::Subscription.new(
  data: {
    endpoint_id: endpoint_id,
    name: 'ruby subscription'
  }
)

subscription_response = subscription.save
```

#### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need to pass the uid from the endpoint we created earlier.

```ruby
event = Convoy::Event.new(
  data: {
    endpoint_id: endpoint_id,
    event_type: "wallet.created",
    data: {
      status: "completed",
      event_type: "wallet.created",
      description: "transaction successful"
    }
  }
)

event_response = event.save
```

#### Install Client

Install convoy-go, with:

```bash terminal
go get github.com/frain-dev/convoy-go/v2
```

#### Configure

```go example
import (
    convoy "github.com/frain-dev/convoy-go/v2"
)

c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
    APIKey: "your_api_key",
})
```

The SDK also supports authenticating via Basic Auth by providing your username and password

```go example
c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
    APIUsername: "default",
    APIPassword: "default",
})
```

In the event you're using a self hosted convoy instance, you can define the url as part of what is passed into the convoy.Options struct

```go example
c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
    APIKey: "your_api_key",
    APIEndpoint: "self-hosted-instance",
})
```

#### Create an Endpoint

```go example
endpoint, err := c.Endpoints.Create(app.UID, &Convoy.CreateEndpointRequest{
    URL: "<your endpoint>",
    Description: "<endpoint description>",
}, nil)

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("failed to create app endpoint \n", err)
}
```

The next step is to create a subscription to the webhook source. Subscriptions are the conduit through which events are routed from a source to a destination on Convoy.

#### Subscribe for Events

```go example
subscription, err := c.Subscriptions.Create(&Convoy.CreateSubscriptionRequest{
    Name: "<subscription name>"
    EndpointID: "<endpoint-id>"
}, nil)

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("failed to create app endpoint \n", err)
}
```

With the subscription in place, you're set to send an event.

#### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need the uid from the application you created earlier.

```go example
event, err := c.Events.Create(&convoy.CreateEventRequest{
    EndpointID: endpoint.UID,
		EventType: "test.customer.event",
		Data:      []byte(`{"event_type": "test.event", "data": { "Hello": "World", "Test": "Data" }`),
	}, nil)

if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("failed to create app event \n", err)
}
```

Sending webhooks with the API does not require a client setup like the SDKs. The API key retrieved from your dashboard will be added to the Authorization header and the project ID will be added to the request URL.

#### Create an Endpoint

An endpoint is a specific destination that can receive webhook events. Once you create an endpoint, you'll receive a uid as part of the response that you should save and supply in subsequent API calls to perform other requests such as creating an event.

```bash terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/api/v1/projects/<project-id>/endpoints \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '
    {
      "name": "Convoy endpoint",
      "description": "Endpoint description",
      "http_timeout": "10s",
      "url": "https://webhook.site/40984a4e-7b36-41fb-a234-9c2006bac8b5"
  }'
```

The next step is to create a subscription to the webhook source. Subscriptions are the conduit through which events are routed from a source to a destination on Convoy.

#### Subscribe for Events

```bash terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/api/v1/projects/<project-id>/subscriptions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "endpoint_id": <endpoint-id>,
    "name": "Subscription name"
}'
```

With the subscription in place, you're set to send an event.

#### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need the uid from the application you created earlier.

```bash terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/api/v1/projects/<project-id>/events \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "endpoint_id": "<endpoint-id>",
    "event_type": "payment.success",
    "data": {
      "event": "payment.success",
      "data": {
        "status": "Completed",
        "description": "Transaction Successful",
        "userID": "test_user_id808"
      }
    }
}'
```

### Cheers! ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully created a Convoy application to send events to your configured endpoint.
