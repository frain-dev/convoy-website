In this guide, you'll learn how to receive your first webhook event with Convoy.

## Prerequisites

To proceed with this guide, you must have the following:

-   A Convoy Cloud account. If you donâ€™t have an account, you can create an account here.
-   A Backend to receive webhook events.

## Receiving webhooks with Convoy

The steps below guide you on how to receive your webhooks using Convoy.

-   Sign into your convoy account from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/):

-   Create an Organisation

An Organisation is the first resource you create on Convoy. It is used to house all other resources needed to receive webhooks.

After creating an organisation, you will be able to create a project from your dashboard. Your dashboard should look like this:

<Frame>![Organisation dashboard](/images/org-dashboard.png)</Frame>

<Tip>A Project is used to isolate several webhooks projects in an organisation.</Tip>

-   **Create an Incoming Webhooks Project**. From your dashboard, click on the Create Project button and select an Incoming webhooks project type:New incoming project

Once your project is created, an API key will be generated and displayed. The API key will be used to authorise operations on your Convoy account from the SDKs and API:

Copy the API key and store it in a secure place. Due to security reasons, the API key can not be displayed after closing the window.

The next step is to configure your project by creating an endpoint, a source and setting your webhook subscription configuration.

-   **Create your endpoint**. An endpoint is a specific destination that can receive webhook events.

Provide the following configuration parameters. For example:

-   Endpoint Description: My primary endpoint
-   Endpoint URL: URL of primary Endpoint.
-   **Create a Source** A Source is an event source. It is what describes how webhook events are ingested into Convoy. Provide the following configuration parameters:
-   Source Name: Incoming source
-   Source Type: Ingestion HTTP
-   Ingestion HTTP Type: None

-   **Subscribe your endpoint to the webhook source**. Finally, you need to subscribe your backend endpoint to the webhook source you created. This can be automatically done, but you can also manually configure this with a toggle as seen in the screenshot above:

-   **Retrieve the Source URL**. Retrieve the source URL generated by Convoy and supply it to your providers to receive webhook events:

**Cheers ðŸŽ‰** That's all. All your webhook events from your configured source will now be sent to your endpoint and can be viewed from your convoy dashboard.
