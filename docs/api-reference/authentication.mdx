Authenticating against the Convoy API requires an API key. You can retrieve and manage your API keys from your project settings dashboard. If 
your key gets compromised you can re-generate it from your dashboard.

Your API keys are sensitive information. Please do not share in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth. 

Authorization headers should be in the following format: `Authorization: Bearer API Key`

```bash  terminal
curl {base_url}/api/v1/projects/{projectID}/{resource}
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d '{ "name": "fintech app" }'
-X POST
```
