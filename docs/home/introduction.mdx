Convoy is an open-source high-performance webhooks gateway to manage millions of webhooks end-to-end.

It is designed to be an highly scalable multi-tenant webhooks gateway to support multiple backend services sending and receiving webhooks. It comes baked in with several features like retries, rate limiting, circuit breaking, customer-facing webhooks dashboards, support for both sending & receiving webhooks and a lot more.

## Why are we building Convoy?

Webhooks are the defacto paradigm for building notifications on the internet. We found that APIs are quite pervasive, systems are interconnected as ever. However, there isnâ€™t a defacto technology and tooling for handling all the naunces that comes with publishing, ingesting and debugging webhook events.

We believe there should be an open-source technology to solve this problem efficiently. We believe teams shouldn't have to rewrite this infrastructure every time they need it. Webhooks are hard from endpoint management, scalable ingress and egress of webhooks traffic. Convoy is our effort at solving this problem. We are focused on truly democratising this software by being open-source.

## Community Edition
