Convoy provides SDK for in-app integration. These SDKs carry out the same operations as the API and Convoy dashboard. The methods in each SDK mirror the [API](/api-reference).

This page introduces you to the SDKs as well as demonstrate the steps involved in sending an event to your Convoy instance.

### Install Client

Install convoy.js with

```json terminal
$ npm install convoy.js
```

### Configure

Next, require the convoy module and setup with your auth credentials.

```json example
const { Convoy } = require("convoy.js");
const convoy = new Convoy({ api_key: "your_api_key" });
```

The SDK also supports authenticating via Basic Auth by defining your username and password.

```json example
const convoy = new Convoy({ username: "default", password: "default" });
```

In the event you're using a self hosted convoy instance, you can define the url as part of what is passed into convoy's constructor.

```json example
const convoy = new Convoy({
  api_key: "your_api_key",
  uri: "self-hosted-instance",
});
```

Create an Endpoint

```json example
try {
  const endpointData = {
    url: "https://0d87-102-89-2-172.ngrok.io",
    description: "Default Endpoint",
    secret: "endpoint-secret",
    events: ["*"],
  },

  const response = await convoy.endpoints.create(appId, endpointData);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

Create a subscription

```json example
try {
  const subscriptionData = {
    "name": "event-sub",
    "endpoint_id": endpointId,
  };

  const response = await convoy.subscriptions.create(subscriptionData);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

With the subscription in place, you're set to send an event.

## Sending an Event

```json example
try {
  const eventData = {
    endpoint_id: endpointId,
    event_type: "payment.success",
    data: {
      event: "payment.success",
      data: {
        status: "Completed",
        description: "Transaction Successful",
        userID: "test_user_id808",
      },
    },
  };

  const response = await convoy.events.create(eventData);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

<Tab title="Ruby">

### Install Client

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby terminal
$ gem 'convoy.rb'
```

And then execute:

```ruby terminal
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby terminal
$ gem install convoy.rb
```

### Configure

To configure your client, provide your `api_key` and `project_id`, see below:

```ruby
require 'convoy'

Convoy.ssl = true
Convoy.api_key = "CO.M0aBe..."
Convoy.project_id = "23b1..."
```

### Create an Endpoint

An endpoint represents a target URL to receive webhook events. You should create one endpoint per user/business or whatever scope works well for you.

```ruby
endpoint = Convoy::Endpoint.new(
  data: {
    "description": "Endpoint One",
    "http_timeout": "1m",
    "url": "https://webhook.site/73932854-a20e-4d04-a151-d5952e873abd"
  }
)

endpoint_response = endpoint.save
```

### Create an Subscription

After creating an endpoint, we need to subscribe the endpoint to events.

```ruby
subscription = Convoy::Subscription.new(
  data: {
    endpoint_id: endpoint_id,
    name: 'ruby subscription'
  }
)

subscription_response = subscription.save
```

### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need to pass the `uid` from the endpoint we created earlier.

```ruby
event = Convoy::Event.new(
  data: {
    endpoint_id: endpoint_id,
    event_type: "wallet.created",
    data: {
      status: "completed",
      event_type: "wallet.created",
      description: "transaction successful"
    }
  }
)

event_response = event.save
```

### Install Client

Install convoy-go with

```golang terminal
$ go get github.com/frain-dev/convoy-go/v2
```

### Configure

```golang example
import (
    convoy "github.com/frain-dev/convoy-go/v2"
)

  c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
      APIKey: "your_api_key",
  })
```

The SDK also supports authenticating via Basic Auth by providing your username and password

```golang example
 c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
      APIUsername: "default",
      APIPassword: "default",
  })
```

In the event you're using a self hosted convoy instance, you can define the url as part of what is passed into the `convoy.Options` struct

```golang example
c := convoy.New(convoy.Options{
     APIKey: "your_api_key",
     APIEndpoint: "self-hosted-instance",
 })
```

### Create an endpoint

```golang example
endpoint, err := c.Endpoints.Create(app.UID, &Convoy.CreateEndpointRequest{
    URL: "http://localhost:8081",
    Description: "Some description",
}, nil)

  if err != nil {
      log.Fatal("failed to create app endpoint \n", err)
  }
```

### Create a Subscription

```golang example
subscription, err := c.Subscriptions.Create(&Convoy.CreateSubscriptionRequest{
  Name: "<subscription name>"
  EndpointID: "<endpoint-id>"
}, nil)

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("failed to create app endpoint \n", err)
}
```

With the subscription in place, you're set to send an event.

### Send an Event

To send an event, you'll need the `uid` from the application we created earlier.

```golang example
event, err := c.Events.Create(&convoy.CreateEventRequest{
        EndpointID: endpoint.UID,
		EventType: "test.customer.event",
		Data:      []byte(`{"event_type": "test.event", "data": { "Hello": "World", "Test": "Data" }}`),
	}, nil)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("failed to create app event \n", err)
	}
```
