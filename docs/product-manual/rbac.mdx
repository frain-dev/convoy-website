title: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
---

Convoy supports role-based access control to manage who can access and perform actions across an instance, organisations, and projects.

## Roles

The following roles are available:

- **Instance Admin** (`instance_admin`): Instance-level access. Can manage all organisations and projects.
- **Organisation Admin** (`organisation_admin`): Organisation-level access. Can manage the organisation and all projects within it.
- **Billing Admin** (`billing_admin`): Organisation-level access. Can manage billing only.
- **Project Admin** (`project_admin`): Project-level access. Can manage project settings and users for the specified project.
- **Project Viewer** (`project_viewer`): Project-level access. Can view project data only.

> Note: A deprecated `api` role may appear in older integrations; it has the lowest rank.

## Role hierarchy

Higher-ranked roles implicitly have all permissions of lower-ranked roles.

- instance_admin → organisation_admin → billing_admin → project_admin → project_viewer → api (deprecated)

## Scopes

Some roles may be scoped to a specific project and optionally an endpoint.

- Project scope: role applies to a single project.
- Endpoint scope: role applies to a single endpoint within the scoped project.

## Permissions mapping (UI)

> <Tip>
> Instance Admin isn’t shown in the dashboard. It’s reserved for instance operations and prevents accidental privilege escalation. It replaces the legacy `super_user` role.
> </Tip>

Convoy's UI uses permissions to toggle actions. Typical mappings:

- Project Viewer: view-only access to events, deliveries, sources, subscriptions, endpoints, portal links, project settings, and organisations (read).
- Project Admin: all Project Viewer permissions plus manage actions on events, sources, subscriptions, endpoints, portal links, meta events, project settings, event types, and project setup.
- Organisation Admin: manage organisation and team; inherits Project Admin and Project Viewer permissions.
- Billing Admin: manage billing.
- Instance Admin: full instance management; inherits Organisation Admin, Billing Admin, Project Admin, and Project Viewer permissions.

## API keys and invites

When creating API keys or inviting members, assign the appropriate role and scope:

- Organisation Admin for org-wide administration.
- Project Admin/Viewer for project-level access.

## Backward compatibility

Older roles such as `super_user`, `admin`, and `member` have been replaced. Ensure clients and automations use the new role names listed above.
