A Portal Link is used to generate a customer-facing dashboard to display information 
on an endpoint's event deliveries. The portal link serves as a medium to quickly generate
portals for users to review and debug events from a publisher. You can generate one 
time links via the dashboard or long-use links to be embedded in your dashboards via the API."

A portal link can be created for one or more endpoints.
