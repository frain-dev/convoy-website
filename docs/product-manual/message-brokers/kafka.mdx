Convoy supports ingesting events from Kafka topics.
This is currently only supported in [outgoing projects](../../product-manual/organizations-and-projects#outgoing-project).

## Connecting to your Kafka topic
To connect your Kafka topic, you need to supply:
- The kafka **cluster hostname and port** (e.g., localhost:9092)
- The **topic name** (e.g., audit-log-events)
- The **number of workers** -- the **number of partitions** for the topic should match the number of workers.
- The **consumer group id** --it is recommended that you set one-- which by default this is set to an empty string.
- Supply authentication configured on the cluster

### Authentication

- Auth types: **PLAIN** and **SCRAM**
- Hash types: **SHA512** and **SHA256**
- TLS: **Enabled** and **Disabled**

## Ingestion Options
There are two ways to ingest events into Convoy from your Kafka topic:
- Format the payload using the structure below as a guide and write it to your topic.
    ```json5 reference payload
     {
        "event_type": "string, required",
        "data": "object, required",
        "custom_headers": { // optional
            "x-convoy-message-type": "single",
            "sample-header": "sample-value"
        },
        "idempotency_key": "string, optional",
        "owner_id": "string, optional", // if included, the event is sent to all endpoints with the owner-id
        "endpoint_id": "string, optional" // if included, the event is sent to a single endpoint
     }
    ```
    > If `x-convoy-message-type` set to **broadcast**, the event will be sent to all endpoints in the project, ignoring both the `endpoint_id` and `owner_id` values.

    For a full list of reference payloads, see [our guide on ingesting events](../../product-manual/events-and-event-deliveries#ingesting-events)
- Send your arbitrarily formatted event payloads to your topic and use Convoy’s transform functions to mutate them at the point of ingestion.
    ```js transform function
    function transform(payload) {
        return {
            "endpoint_id": "",
            "owner_id": "",
            "event_type": "sample",
            "data": payload, // payload contains arbitrary message data read from your topic
            "custom_headers": {
                "sample-header": "sample-value"
            },
            "idempotency_key": ""
        }
    }
    ```

## Things to note
- Messages are read of the topic one-by-one by each worker reading off a partition.
- Acknowledgements are done per message.
- Ingestion is rate-limited (50 per second), and this can be configured by setting the `CONVOY_INGEST_RATE` environment variable.
