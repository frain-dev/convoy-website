'og:description': Convoy adopts an incremental approach with feature flags to release new features.

Several new features usually start out as `experimental` features before moving to `general availability`. These features are disabled by default, and needs to be specifically enabled to use. They may be enabled by default in future versions.

Experimental features aren't stable yet and their behaviour and API are subject to change in future releases, so enable them with care. All changes are communicated via our [Changelog](/release-notes/releases). 

You can enable any of the `experimental` features using the `--enable-feature-flag` flag or `CONVOY_ENABLE_FEATURE_FLAG` environment variable with a comma separated list of features.
