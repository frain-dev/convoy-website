By completing the rigorous SOC2 auditing process conducted by Insight Assurance, we have validated our alignment with the stringent requirements for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy as outlined in the SOC2 framework. Achieving this compliance is a critical step in continually improving our security posture, risk management procedures, and ability to safeguard client data.

We want to extend our sincere thanks to the team at Insight Assurance for their expert evaluation during the audit. Their depth of experience and meticulous analysis were instrumental in verifying our policies, processes, and controls meet SOC2 standards.

This achievement of SOC2 Type 1 compliance reflects our ongoing commitment to upholding their best interests through strict adherence to industry regulations and compliance frameworks.

While this is an important milestone, we recognize that maintaining compliance requires continued diligence and improvement. As we look ahead, we remain dedicated to transparency, ethical data practices, and providing our customers with the highest level of security and accountability. We will continue optimizing our controls and protocols to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification soon.

We want to thank our valued customers for their support and confidence as we have worked to attain this meaningful compliance status. We look forward to our continued partnership.
