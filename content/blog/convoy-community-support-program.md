Hello, there!

We are excited to announce the launch of the Convoy Community Support Program. Our goal is to create a collection of projects that engage the community, inspire ambassadors, and spread the word about Convoy far and wide.

At [Convoy](http://getconvoy.io), we are committed to building a community of engineers that care about being efficient. We believe that by working together, we can create a more fun and engaging community where members play a huge role in the advancement of platform engineering. 

To kick things off, we've got two exciting projects in the works that we believe will be a great start to our community support program.

## Speak-for-Convoy Project

The first project is called the Speak-for-Convoy project. We want to encourage more of our community members ([and prospective members](https://convoy-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-xiuuoj0m-yPp~ylfYMCV9s038QL0IUQ#/shared-invite/email)) to not only attend attend developer events but also give talks about their experiences with Convoy. We believe that the more people hear about us, the more vibrant our community will become and the more platform engineers get more efficient.

If you're interested in speaking at an event, we'll reward you with up to  Â£200 per event, if accepted. But more than that, we believe that speaking about your experiences with Convoy is a great way to build your personal brand, connect with other engineers, and inspire others to join our community.

## Pizza Project

Our second project is the Pizza Project. We're a small team at Convoy, but we're ambitious and want to attend as many developer events as possible. We're particularly interested in events related to platform engineering, webhooks, open-source technology, and the DevOps space.

And because we cannot be everywhere at once, If you're a community builder whose events fall within these categories, we'll buy pizzas for your events. In return, you can show a few slides about Convoy. We believe that this is a great way to build relationships with other engineers, get feedback on our technology, and spread the word about Convoy to those who might possibly be interested.

## Our Commitment to the Community

We're excited to see these programs take off and become the foundation of our ambassadorship program at Convoy. We're committed to supporting our growing community and hope you'll join us on this journey.

In addition to these programs, we're also working on other initiatives that we believe will be beneficial to the community. Our goal is to create a platform where engineers can share their ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other.

We're also committed to providing resources and support to our ambassadors. Whether you need help with your presentation, networking opportunities, or just want to bounce ideas off someone, we're here to help.

## Join Us

We believe that building a strong community is essential to our success as a company. We're excited to see what we can accomplish together and hope that you'll join us on this journey.

If you're interested in speaking at an event, hosting a pizza party, or just want to learn more about our community support program, [please reach out to me on the Convoy Community Slack](https://convoy-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-xiuuoj0m-yPp~ylfYMCV9s038QL0IUQ#/shared-invite/email).

Let's make it happen,

The Convoy Team
