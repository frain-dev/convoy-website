## Introduction

Welcome to day 5 of Convoy Launch week! We are thrilled to unveil two exciting features that will elevate your experience with Convoy:

1. Access Control
2. Advanced Portal Links

In this article, we will delve into these groundbreaking features and explore the immense value they bring to Convoy's offering. Whether you're a developer seeking flexibility and efficiency or a user craving seamless access to event data, these features are designed to revolutionize the way you and your customers interact with Convoy.

## Access Control

For Enterprise & Cloud Users Role-Based Access Control is now fully enabled. You can now assign one of three roles to every member you invite to organisation;  `super_user` `admin` `member`. This feature provides organisation level control over team member permissions, allowing you to define roles based on individual responsibilities and requirements. By implementing Access Control, you can ensure that the right people have the right access to your Convoy projects and dashboard, significantly enhancing security.

For example, as a `super_user`, you can have full access to all Convoy functionalities, including adding and removing team members. `member`, on the other hand, may have access to view the dashboard, retry events and event deliveries. Give our [cloud platform](https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/) a go!

### Advanced Portal Links

We’re also excited to announce Advanced Portal Links! Previously, portal links only enabled engineers to look at their event logs, and retry event deliveries amongst other things, however, they were not allowed to edit or create endpoints. We’re introducing an opt-in setting for portal links that allows you to control whether portal link users can edit or create endpoints. This gives you the flexibility to choose who has the authority to make changes.

Engineers can now not only review event logs and retry event deliveries but also make necessary adjustments to endpoints right from the portal. This saves time and eliminates the need for back-and-forth communication or involving other teams. If you select the `Owner ID` option, creating endpoints through the portal is allowed, opening up new possibilities for teamwork. Let's say your customers’ team needs to review their endpoint urls, instead of waiting for access or going through complicated procedures, they can now initiate the process themselves, or if they wanted a new endpoint with their `owner_id` so fan out events to that `owner_id` reach the new endpoint. This promotes agility and keeps things moving smoothly.

Take a look at the screenshots we provided. It shows a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and manage endpoints and event deliveries. You can quickly see all your existing endpoints and make edits, and in the second screenshot you’ll notice the `Add Endpoint` at the top right, this portal link using the `Owner ID` option, in this portal you can create a new endpoint. We've designed it to be intuitive, so even if you're new to using portal links, you'll find it straightforward.

We're thrilled about the potential impact of Advanced Portal Links. It's all about fostering collaboration, empowering engineers, and simplifying endpoint management. We can't wait to see how this feature enhances the efficiency and productivity of your team.
