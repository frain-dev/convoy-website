TL;DR: A couple of weeks ago, we had a launch on Product Hunt, it was a fun experience and in this blog I will share what we found, what we did and all about how we managed to get to the Top 10 product list of the day competing with a lot of shiny hot AI tools in March.

# Before Launch day ‚è∞

We had done a launch a year ago when we started the Convoy journey, so for [this launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/convoy-3#convoy-4), we wanted to do more research and find out better ways to hit our goal which was to get to top 5 product of the day. Here are a few things we found out from other people who have had success with Product Hunt launches and documented their experiences:

## Build a strong community

The power of your personal network and that of your team should not be underestimated. Reach out to friends, family, and colleagues to upvote and share your product on Product Hunt. You can also leverage communities on social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to expand your reach. Building a community around your product can help increase engagement and generate buzz.

## Follow active Product Hunt users

Following active Product Hunt users can be a valuable strategy to help you reach the Top 10 Product of the Day spot. Active users are often early adopters who are enthusiastic about discovering and sharing new products. By following them, they can get notified about you and if they follow back, can subsequently get notified about all your launches right in their mailbox. This can help generate buzz and increase engagement on launch day. Additionally, active users may be more likely to upvote and share your product, which can help increase your visibility on the platform. 

For us, it was not so easy finding lots of active PH users, however we did find some and followed them and some of them followed back.

## Get a popular Hunter

A hunter on Product Hunt is someone who submits new products to the platform. They can be individuals or companies who have a trusted reputation within the community. They do not necessarily have to be the builders of these products, product owners are called Makers on Product Hunt and they can also hunt their own products themselves. Due to the fact that you can follow people or companies on PH, hunters can grow a massive following and thereby become influencers of some sort. 

Having a popular hunter submit your product can greatly increase your chances of success on Product Hunt, as it gives your product more visibility and credibility. We talked to our investor, YC and Michael Seibel agreed to Hunt us and this is one of the perks of being in the YC community. Michael has hunted hundreds of products on Product Hunt and most especially in the devtools category which Convoy is part of.

## Launch by 12am PT

Timing is everything on Product Hunt. Launch your product during a time when the community is most active or before they get active, the first 10 hours are usually the most active period and most upvotes are gotten within the first 2-3 hours of any launch. You can also consider launching on a day when there are fewer competing products, increasing your chances of standing out. Keep in mind that launching too early or too late can impact your visibility and reduce your chances of making it to the Top 10.

## Clear and Concise Messaging

We took our time to draft straight-to-the-point messaging for the launch post, the first maker comment and the tagline. [Convoy](http://getconvoy.io) is a reliable webhooks gateway for engineers that value efficiency. We also made sure to visually show and reinforce our value proposition, in a slideshow manner which Product Hunt lets you do. We also saw that a good percentage of products hunted by Michael that got to Top 10 animated their logos, so we did so too.

# On Launch day üöÄ

Now that we have everything from blobs of texts to share with our community members, to the ones to share on social media and to our investors and even with the YC community, we were [ready to launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/convoy-3#convoy-4).

## When did we launch?

We took some time to study our hunter‚Äôs hunting history and we saw that the products he hunted on Wednesdays did better than products hunted on any other day of the week, so we chose a Wednesday. This might be completely different from what you find online about what day to launch, I think the best answer is, it depends, so have fun with it. 

We chose and stuck to the time we had already read so much about, 12am PT, that was 8am in London (GMT) and so we were up and ready to share the news with everyone we knew.

## Leveraging Community and Investor Networks

We had an internal launch party at Convoy and leveraged personal networks of everyone on the team to share the news about our launch. We reached out to all the communities we were active on, including the YC and OnDeck communities and most especially the Convoy community itself through email and on slack. 

We also informed a host of our backers to help us spread word about out launch, and then upvote and leave comments. 

## Using Twitter & LinkedIn and replying comments

We shared everything on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/getconvoy/status/1640974579962195970?s=20) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/convoy-webhooks_convoy-high-performance-open-source-webhooks-activity-7046751585208569857-Dwx6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), when our customers left comments about their experience using Convoy to manage their webhooks, we re-shared it on these platforms. This brought even more attention and shares of the launch, some of which led to upvotes.

This was the primary job of the day, we encouraged people to leave comments after they had upvoted and we replied to almost all the comments that was left. Some people also went ahead to leave reviews of the product too as PH allows users to do both. 

## The Result üèÜ

All of these got us to [Product #7 of the day](https://www.producthunt.com/products/convoy-3#convoy-4) and 39th product of the week. Our upvotes grew by over 42% and we had a 67% growth in comments all compared to the last launch we did. We got more stars on our project on GitHub and we think this was a successful launch and we are grateful to all the Convoy community members and all other people who made this launch possible. We were 2 positions short of our goal of getting to Top 5 products of the day, and we would share lessons we learned about PH launches in another blog soon.
