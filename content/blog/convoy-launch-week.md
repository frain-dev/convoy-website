## Our very first Launch Week

This quarter, we are doing things a little differently. We're proud to announce our first Launch Week from June 26th to June 30th, 2023. It will be five days of launching new features/products every day of that week. [Register here to be notified about Launch Week](https://launchweek.getconvoy.io).

## Why Launch Week

During the last quarter, we experimented with something similar to a launch week in March. Although it was not planned, we observed how engaging it was for us at Convoy and have decided to fully adopt it. Here are some reasons why we're headed in this new direction:

### Product Release Intentionality

In the past, we would build products and release them as we went along, communicating with our customers and the community as we did. However, we now want to be as intentional with the release process as we are with the building process.

Our goal is to get as many people as possible excited about new Convoy product releases. We have already made some progress in this regard. Recently, we adopted the Sentry-style product release strategy to better fit our pace, enforce good release habits, and ensure we move faster. You can learn more about this strategy in our blog post, [Why We Adopted the Sentry-Style Release Strategy](https://getconvoy.io/blog/why-we-adopted-sentry-style-release-strategy).

### Roadmap Accountability

The Convoy product roadmap has been public for some time now, as you can see [here](https://github.com/orgs/frain-dev/projects/3/views/1). We have also shared our thoughts about why we decided to open-source our roadmap and what we hope to achieve by doing so, which you can read about [here](https://getconvoy.io/blog/making-convoy-webhooks-gateway-roadmap-public).

With Launch Week, we want to begin announcing features in the roadmap that we plan to work on in the upcoming quarter to the community. By doing so, we hope to be held accountable for our plans and build anticipation and excitement among the community.

### Involving the Community

As you may already know, the community is at the core of everything we do at Convoy, we are constantly seeking ways to involve our customers and the community in our product releases. To that end, we plan to hold Q&A and AMA sessions on the community call on the last day and have on-stage conversations with community members.

### Content Creation

As an engineering-first company, we prioritize creating content to support our products and guides to help people get comfortable using webhooks. However, sometimes this work may not be given the proper priority it deserves. To address this, we propose having a dedicated period every quarter when engineers can laser-focus on creating content that supports the products we build. We believe this will be super helpful.

## What to Expect

Expect multiple announcements every day, new products will be announced, including Demos and Convoy customer spotlights too. We will close the week with a community call on Friday.
