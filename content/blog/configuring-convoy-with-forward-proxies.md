# Introduction

A forward proxy or a proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between clients and servers, forwarding requests on behalf of clients and providing additional services such as caching, security and anonymity. At times, webhook consumers require API providers to send webhooks from predefined IP addresses. A forward proxy can provide you with privacy and anonymity for your servers running convoy by masking their IP addresses. This ensures you can now route webhooks traffic through a dedicated egress.

We'll be exploring how you can configure Stripe's [SmokeScreen](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen) and [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) to work as a forward proxy with Convoy.

## Configuring SmokeScreen

Stripe's Smokescreen is a powerful tool that can be used as a forward proxy for Convoy, it can be used to achieve Static IPs for your outbound webhook events.

To configure Smokescreen as a forward proxy for Convoy, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen) to install smokescreen on your server.

Start smokescreen by running:

```shell
smokescreen --listen-port <your-desired-proxy-port>
```

You can configure your proxy URL with Convoy using the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable or within your convoy.json file:

```json
"server": {
  "http": {
    "proxy": "<smokescreen-url>",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_cert_file": "",
    "ssl_key_file": "",
    "port": 5005
  }
},
```

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Smokescreen allows you to specify access control lists, these help prevent IP spoofing attacks.

```yaml
---
version: v1
services:
  - name: enforce-dummy-srv
    project: usersec
    action: enforce
    allowed_domains:
      - example1.com
      - example2.com
      - deny1.com # overrides global deny list

  - name: report-dummy-srv
    project: security
    action: report
    allowed_domains:
      - example3.com

global_allow_list:
  - goodexample1.com
  - goodexample2.com
  - goodexample3.com
  - conflictingexample.com

global_deny_list:
  - deny1.com
  - deny2.com
  - conflictingexample.com
```
The `enforce` action makes smokescreen strictly follow the defined rule, as opposed to `report` which allows the rule to be broken with a warning.
For more extensive documentation of Smokescreen's configuration see [here](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen).

## Configuring Nginx

Nginx is a fast HTTP Proxy Server. It is usually used as a reverse proxy, but it can also serve as a forward proxy.

Nginx can be configured as a forward proxy, however the default configuration doesn't work very well with HTTPS connections. A solution for this, is to build and compile Nginx with the [ngx_http_proxy_connect_module](https://github.com/chobits/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module). The module allows the forward proxying work well with SSL connnections.

Using Docker, here's how you can build a custom Nginx image with the `ngx_http_proxy_connect_module` installed

1. Define your `Dockerfile` file:

```
FROM nginx:1.25.1-alpine

ENV NGINX_VERSION 1.25.1

# Download sources
# For latest build deps, see https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/blob/master/mainline/alpine/Dockerfile
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && \
    apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps \
    gcc \
    libc-dev \
    make \
    openssl-dev \
    pcre-dev \
    zlib-dev \
    linux-headers \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    libxslt-dev \
    gd-dev \
    geoip-dev \
    patch \
    bash \
    git \
    openssh

RUN wget "http://nginx.org/download/nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz" -O nginx.tar.gz
RUN git clone "https://github.com/chobits/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module"

RUN tar -zxC / -f nginx.tar.gz && \
    cd /nginx-$NGINX_VERSION && \
    patch -p1 < /ngx_http_proxy_connect_module/patch/proxy_connect_rewrite_102101.patch && \
    ./configure \
    --prefix=/etc/nginx \
    --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx \
    --modules-path=/usr/lib/nginx/modules \
    --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
    --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log \
    --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log \
    --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid \
    --lock-path=/var/run/nginx.lock \
    --http-client-body-temp-path=/var/cache/nginx/client_temp \
    --http-proxy-temp-path=/var/cache/nginx/proxy_temp \
    --http-fastcgi-temp-path=/var/cache/nginx/fastcgi_temp \
    --http-uwsgi-temp-path=/var/cache/nginx/uwsgi_temp \
    --http-scgi-temp-path=/var/cache/nginx/scgi_temp \
    --with-perl_modules_path=/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl \
    --user=nginx \
    --group=nginx \
    --with-compat \
    --with-file-aio \
    --with-threads \
    --with-http_addition_module \
    --with-http_auth_request_module \
    --with-http_dav_module \
    --with-http_flv_module \
    --with-http_gunzip_module \
    --with-http_gzip_static_module \
    --with-http_mp4_module \
    --with-http_random_index_module \
    --with-http_realip_module \
    --with-http_secure_link_module \
    --with-http_slice_module \
    --with-http_ssl_module \
    --with-http_stub_status_module \
    --with-http_sub_module \
    --with-http_v2_module \
    --with-mail \
    --with-mail_ssl_module \
    --with-stream \
    --with-stream_realip_module \
    --with-stream_ssl_module \
    --with-stream_ssl_preread_module \
    --add-dynamic-module=/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module && \
    make && make install

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

EXPOSE 8080

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

2. Add the `nginx.conf` file with the forward proxy configuration

```nginx
load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_http_proxy_connect_module.so;

worker_processes  auto;

events {}

http {
    server {
        listen                         8080;

        # dns resolver used by forward proxying
        resolver                       8.8.8.8;

        # forward proxy for CONNECT requests
        proxy_connect;
        proxy_connect_connect_timeout  10s;
        proxy_connect_data_timeout     10s;

        # defined by yourself for non-CONNECT requests
        # Example: reverse proxy for non-CONNECT requests
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://$host;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }
}
```

Once you've built the image and have it running in a container, you can now update your `convoy.json` with the proxy URL.

```json
"server": {
  "http": {
    "proxy": "http://localhost:8080",
    "ssl": false,
    "ssl_cert_file": "",
    "ssl_key_file": "",
    "port": 5005
  }
}
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?

We plan on adding more support for other platforms you can configure to work as a forward proxy with Convoy such as [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy), [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) etc.

You can stay up to date with the docs [here](https://getconvoy.io/docs/forward-proxies/smokescreen) to keep track of when the documentation is added.
