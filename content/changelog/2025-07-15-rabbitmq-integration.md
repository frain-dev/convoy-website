We've added support for RabbitMQ as a message broker source! This means you can now:

- Connect to both self-hosted and cloud RabbitMQ instances
- Ingest events directly from your existing queues
- Use all the same filtering and transformation features

This integration works seamlessly with our existing message broker catalog, making it easier than ever to integrate Convoy into your existing infrastructure.
