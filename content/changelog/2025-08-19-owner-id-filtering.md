Thanks to GitHub user [nitzangoldfeder](https://github.com), who contributed to this PR, Convoy can now ingest events from RabbitMQ. This integration is a welcome addition to our message broker catalog and will work with both self-hosted and cloud instances. It works similarly to the other message broker integrations.
