![Core Gateway](/static/Core-Gateway-OG.png)

We shipped bug fixes, better observability, and a refactored data layer for the Core Gateway.

**Fixes & observability**

Endpoints in **Paused** or **Inactive** state now activate correctly, and OSS default-user login no longer requires an organization. We fixed filter evaluation for boolean values in arrays and a startup bug where the worker blocked the agent server. For Sentry, you can set `CONVOY_SENTRY_DEBUG=true` and `CONVOY_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` to get debug logging and environment tagging. We added a PostgreSQL materialized view for Prometheus aggregator queries (concurrent refresh, better migration logs, graceful exit). MV refresh is disabled by default for now; we'll re-enable it after validation.

**Data layer**

We refactored the data layer to use [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) for type-safe SQL across API keys, configuration, delivery attempts, organisations, portal links, projects, sources, and filters. Behaviour is unchanged and no config or API changes are required on your side.

Upgrade for the fixes and observability improvements.
