# SDK

Convoy provides SDK for in-app integration. These SDKs carry out the same operations as the API and Convoy dashboard. The methods in each SDK mirror the [API](https://convoy.readme.io/reference).


This page introduces you to the SDKs as well as demonstrate the steps involved in sending an event to your Convoy instance.
