### Release Cycle
We adopt a time-based release schedule.  A new release is created on the 25th of every month, over the course of the month we ship patches and bug fixes for that release. This is a similar pattern adopted by some open-core companies we like i.e. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/). Convoy adopts [SemVar v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
