### Release Cycle
We adopt a time-based release schedule; this means we release a new software update on the 25th of every month. Over the course of the month we break this cycle to ship security patches and severe bug fixes reported. We decided to adopt this pattern to constantly be shipping updates to our users. This is similar pattern adopted by open source companies like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/) and [Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).
