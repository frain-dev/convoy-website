# Convoy

Convoy is your one-stop tool for publishing and receiving webhooks. With our open source software, you have the flexibility to deploy the software to a location that best suites your infrastructure and ensure customer data never has to leave your infrastructure.

## Why we're building Convoy

Webhooks is the defacto paradigm for building notifications on the internet.

We found that APIs are quite pervasive, systems are interconnected as ever. However, there isnâ€™t a defacto technology and tooling for handling all the naunces that comes with publishing, ingesting and debugging webhook events.

Convoy solves that and provides you with options to get started with publishing, ingesting and debugging webhook events.

## Convoy Cloud

[Convoy Cloud](https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/signup) is our SaaS solution where we manage the underlying infrastructure for you, and you can focus on publishing and receiving webhooks only.

## Convoy OSS

Convoy OSS is our open-source software where you manage the infrastructure by yourselves, and user data never leaves your infrastructure.
