# Hobby
We provide an easy way to deploy Convoy without spending a ton on infrastructure costs. It is aimed at users who want to test out the platform and understand its use-cases.

## Pre-requisites
- You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine. 
- Anything between a $10/month (2GB RAM) to $20/month (4GB RAM) droplet will work fine.
- You have ssh access to the VM. You'd need ssh access to the VM to run commands from time to time.


### Quick Install on an Ubuntu VM
1. Head over to your DNS provider and configure an A record to your VM's IP address. 

2. SSH into the VM and run the following:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frain-dev/convoy/main/deploy/vm-deploy)"
    ```

4. Visit your domain name and login with the default credentials:
   + **Username**: superuser@default.com
   + **Password**: default
### Upgrading
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frain-dev/convoy/main/deploy/vm-upgrade)"
```
