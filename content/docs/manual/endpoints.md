Endpoints
======

## Endpoint

An endpoint is a specific destination that can receive webhook events. An endpoint can be configured with `http_timeout`. Endpoints can be managed over the API and the dashboard.

### Endpoint State
An endpoint can be in either of two states: `active` or `inactive`. The `active` state means the endpoint is responding normally, and Convoy will continue to send events to it. The `inactive` state, on the other hand means the endpoint has consecutively failed to process events. In this state, all new events will be set to the `Discarded` state and **will not be sent** to the endpoint.

To re-activate the endpoint -- retry any failed or discarded event delivery, if it's successfully, the endpoint will be set to `active`. Then you can batch retry all failed events that weren't processed while the endpoint was `inactive`.

### Zero Downtime Key Rotation
Because webhooks rely on a shared secret that needs to be rotated periodically to be kept safe, convoy ships with a mechanism for zero downtime key rotation. This can be trigger from both the API -- [this endpoint](https://convoy.readme.io/reference/put_api-v1-projects-projectid-endpoints-endpointid-expire-secret) and the dashboard, see below:

Once the secret is expired, conovy will send more than one message digest pending the full expiration of the old secret. You can learn more about [signatures](/docs/manual/signatures)

### Endpoint authentication

Endpoint authentication is a scenario where the endpoint owner needs to specify an authentication mechanism separate from signatures to validate the webhook origin. New and existing endpoints can now require an API Key to authenticate against the endpoint. In the future, we hope to support more authentication mechanisms.

### Portal Links

A [Portal Link](/docs/manual/portal-link) is used to generate a customer-facing dashboard to display information on an endpoint's event deliveries. The portal link serves as a medium to quickly generate portals for users to review and debug events from a publisher. You can generate one time links via the dashboard or long-use links to be embedded in your dashboards via the API. To learn more, click [here](/docs/manual/portal-link)
