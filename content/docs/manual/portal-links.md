# Portal links

A portal link is used to generate a mini-event dashboard to display information on an endpoint's event deliveries. The portal link serves as a medium to quickly generate portals for users to review and debug events from a publisher.

Once a portal link is created, the link can be copied from the same page or the portal links page.
