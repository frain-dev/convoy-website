Sources
======

Sources are how events are routed into the system. In this segment, we discuss the various types of sources and their use cases. Convoy currently supports two types of sources: REST API sources and HTTP Ingested sources.

## REST API

This is an authenticated API to push events to a Convoy instance. It is designed for an outgoing event project to push events to a specific endpoint. This source is only and automatically available for all outgoing projects.

## HTTP Ingestion

This is an unauthenticated API to receive webhook events from third-party webhook providers like Github, Shopify etc, It is designed for incoming projects to receive events from any provider. For each provider, a source needs to be configured with its necessary verification. Once configured, we provide you with a unique link to be supplied to the provider. 

### Verification

Source verification can be configured in four different ways on Convoy:

1. **Hmac:** Hmac is a common mechanism most providers support for webhooks. Providers like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com) etc. Creating a Hmac source looks like the below:
![create hmac source](/docs-assets/ingest-hmac.png)

For HMAC verification mechanism, Convoy provides support for [simple and advanced signatures](/docs/manual/signatures).

2. **Basic Authentication:** While not popular supported some providers user this mechanism to verify events. Creating a Basic Auth source looks like the below:
![create basic auth source](/docs-assets/ingest-basic.png)

3. **API Keys:** Similar to Basic Authentication, API Keys while not popular are used by some providers to verify events. Providers like [Mono](https://mono.co)

4. **Custom Verification:** For some providers, like [Github](https://github.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com) the core verification mechanisms aren't sufficient. Though they are wrap around the core mechanisms, these modules have to be built specifically for eah provider. 

Currently, we have support for [GitHub](https://github.com), and have planned support for [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Shopify](https://shopify.com). You can request new sources by sending an email to `support@getconvoy.io`.
