# Static IPs

Static IP addresses are how we ensure all webhook events originate from the correct source without malicious entities impersonating the source. This added security was added for users with strict firewall restrictions. If you're deploying your Convoy instance, please read our [deployment guide](/docs/deploy/overview) on how to set the egress server to ensure IP addresses don't change.

## Convoy Cloud IPs

For our cloud customers who are subscribed on a plan with Static IPs, all webhook events will originate from the following IP addresses:

```
159.223.160.239
147.182.169.205
```
