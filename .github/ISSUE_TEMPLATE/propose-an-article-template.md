## Working Title
    Example: A Rubyist’s Guide to Database Transactions
    
## Briefly describe the article.
    
    Example: Database transactions can be intimidating, but they’re super important in many common use cases. This article will teach Rubyists everything they need to know about transactions, from the DB level through active record and larger architectural concerns.
    
## List 4 - 6 main topics
    - Example:
    - What are transactions?
    - When should you use them?
    - How to use them in raw SQL
    - How to use them in Rails
    - Pitfalls to watch out for.

## Describe the audience as specifically as possible.
    - Example: Intermediate ruby developers working with DBs in Rails

## What value does it provide them?
    - Example: This article will teach them how to maintain their DB's integrity during complex updates that have to be correct - such as when dealing with currency.

## What do you hope will make this article special/unique/attention-getting?
    - Example:
    While lots of articles cover one aspect of DB transactions, this article covers all of them in one place. A reader could begin reading knowing nothing about them and will leave knowing how and when to use them in production.
